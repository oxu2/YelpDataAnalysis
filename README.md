# YelpDataAnalysis
This project will focus on Sandwich restaurants with data from Yelp, and the target is to analyze the reviews and provide data-driven suggestions to business owners. Specifically, it will categorize all the reviews by topic, and for each sandwich business, find out the reasons why they have received good reviews or bad reviews. Consumer behaviors and preferences are discussed in this project in order to provide businesses with unique business strategies in different seasons.
